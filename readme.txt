= Lead-generating landing pages =

Choose from 250+ conversion-optimized templates, then customize your look with the drag-and-drop builder. No coding or web design experience is required—change colors, add text, and upload images with just a few clicks of your mouse.

These pages aren’t just easy to build… they work. In fact, Leadpages landing pages convert 5x better than the industry average.

Here are a few more reasons to build your pages with Leadpages:
* Get real-time conversion tips as you build.
* Enjoy blazingly fast page speeds.
* Use AI copywriting and image generation tools to quickly create content.

= Conversion tools =

Turning website visitors into customers just got a whole lot easier. Bring attention to your lead magnets, sales, and giveaways with pop-ups and alert bars, and then lock in the conversion with high-converting forms.

Have an offer you want to draw attention to? Create a timed or exit intent pop-up to capture users’ attention and ensure they don’t leave your site empty-handed. If you’re looking for something a little less intrusive than an alert bar (a small colored bar that appears at the top of the screen) is another option. You can also create a sense of urgency for your limited-time offers with countdown timers.

When visitors are ready to take action, capture their information with a lead gen form. Collect email addresses and automatically deliver lead magnets—or integrate your forms with your email marketing platform for even more options.

Finally, when visitors are ready to make a purchase they can do so right from your website. Add checkout forms to any page without having to send visitors to third-party sites.

= Manage your leads =

Leadpages doesn’t just help you acquire leads—it also helps you to make the most of your leads once you get them.

Do away with clunky spreadsheets. With the Leadpages, you can search, filter, and manage your leads right inside the Leads Library. Need even more lead management tools? Seamlessly integrate your Leadpages account with your favorite CRM platform.

Leadpages also notifies you as soon as you get a lead so you can reach out to them while your brand is still top of mind.

= Track your progress =

Stay in the know about how your pages are performing. See how many visitors are landing on your pages, track your conversion rates and leads, and make adjustments based on your findings.

To maximize your results, use Leadpages’ A/B testing tool. Create multiple versions of your landing page to test different text, image, and CTA button variations. See which version produces the most conversions and keep testing until your page is completely optimized.
